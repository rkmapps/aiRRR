# aiRRR

aiRRR is an AI and AR based system where an individual wearing an AR glass is able to identify another individual using face recognition upon a face-to-face interaction (in a meeting) and then retrieves the summary of recent digital conversations between them and finally suggest intelligent short responses within the context that aid in efficient communication

**aiRRR in Action (Scenario in a software organization)**
In a software organization, a software development manager (SDM) wearing an AR glass organizes a bug resolution hybrid meeting (physical and virtual simultaneously) with the testing team. Utilizing AI-based microservices, the AR glass will do face recognition of members (depending on the direction of gaze by SDM) attending the meeting (physically/virtually) and retrieve their details (Name, Dept, Seating Location, Reporting Authority) and display it on the glass.

If the SDM intends to interact with a Software Testing Lead (STL) regarding a critical bug, he would get a summary (text summarization) of the earlier interactions done with the STL on the company owned email/messaging/meeting platform regarding the bug.

The SDM may want to provide an update on the bug during the meeting, so a short response may be drafted by advanced AI-based systems to assist the SDM in initiating a dialog/conversation regarding the bug.
