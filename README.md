# aiRRR - Interaction based Recognition, Rumination & Response using AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AR (Augmented Reality)

aiRRR is an AI and AR based system where an individual wearing an AR glass is able to identify another individual using face recognition upon a face-to-face interaction (in a meeting) and then retrieves the summary of recent digital conversations between them and finally suggest intelligent short responses within the context that aid in efficient communication

## aiRRR in Action (Scenario in a software organization)
In a software organization, a software development manager (SDM) wearing an AR glass organizes a bug resolution hybrid meeting (physical and virtual simultaneously) with the testing team. Utilizing AI-based microservices, the AR glass will do face recognition of members (depending on the direction of gaze by SDM) attending the meeting (physically/virtually) and retrieve their details (Name, Dept, Seating Location, Reporting Authority) and display it on the glass.

If the SDM intends to interact with a Software Testing Lead (STL) regarding a critical bug, he would get a summary (text summarization) of the earlier interactions done with the STL on the company owned email/messaging/meeting platform regarding the bug.

The SDM may want to provide an update on the bug during the meeting, so a short response may be drafted by advanced AI-based systems to assist the SDM in initiating a dialog/conversation regarding the bug.

## Benefits of using aiRRR app:
1. Productive interactions within the organization
2. Shorter physical/virtual meetings & Quicker resolution of bugs saving time
3. More scenarios could be explored using the above model reaping greater benefits for the organization
